# Graphs

A Graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:
 1. A finite set of vertices also called nodes.
 2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(digraph). 
    The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
    
**Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications**:<br>
* Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. For example Google GPS
* Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender and locale.

**Directed and Undirected Graphs**:

* Directed Graphs: The Directed graphs are such graphs in which edges are directed in a single direction.
  For Example, the below graph is a directed graph.

* **Undirected Graphs**: Undirected graphs are such graphs in which the edges are directionless or in other words bi-directional. That is, if there is an edge between vertices u      and v then it means we can use the edge to go from both u to v and v to u.
 
   Following is an example of an undirected graph with 5 vertices:
